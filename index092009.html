They are still a fixture of American culture. Most  newspapers carry at least one daily puzzle, and they are enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds.</span> </p>
          <p class="MainH">Not So Simple</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">The crosswords you see in books and newspapers meet exacting standards for symmetry and composition. Those who solve crosswords regularly have an intuitive understanding of these rules, but may not realize all that goes into a puzzle's construction.</p>

          <p class="MainH">A close cousin: &quot;Vocabulary&quot; or &quot;Crisscross&quot; Puzzles</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">Crisscross puzzles look like a Scrabble game. They're a popular format for grade-school  vocabulary puzzles. A crisscross has its uses, but a crossword fan is not likely to consider it a substitute. </p>
          <p align="center" class="TabbedPanelsContent"><img src="images/Compare.jpg" alt="Comparison" width="469" height="257" /></p>
          <p align="left" class="TabbedPanelsContent">I offer crisscross puzzles as an alternative when it makes sense. They take less time to solve and are entirely subject-specific, so they make great table gifts at a large party. These puzzles are created by a computer, and there are several teachers' web sites where you can create a crisscross  for free. I add value by 1) offering font and layout options to suit your purpose; 2) handling the production and printing for you; and 3) helping you select and phrase clues. </p>

          <p class="sidebar">Crosswords are as much about <strong>culture</strong> as they are about language. A computer puzzle is not as likely to include current phrases, or even pop phrases from the past (&quot;Where's the beef?&quot;).

You tell me what you want to say; we will develop the custom content together and I will build the puzzle to meet your goals.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">Your puzzle is an original work. You may use and reprint the puzzle as often as you like, provided that the puzzle is not modified or resold. You can expect:</p>
          <ol>

            <li class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong class="TabbedPanelsContent">Daily Size (15x15).</strong> Many puzzles can be designed to be the size in most daily papers. This is a good size for the recreational puzzle solver. From $295; higher with tricky content, but slightly lower if I can find an excuse to charge less.</li>
            <li class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Sunday Size (21x21)</strong>. Puzzles that include long phrases/names may need to be the size of a typical Sunday puzzle. A large puzzle takes much longer to create. I only recommend this option in specific situations. $785 and up.</li>
            <li class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong class="TabbedPanelsContent">Crisscross.</strong>Technically not a crossword, this puzzle type makes sense in some settings, such as a table game at a large party. $125 for puzzles with up to 30 entries.</li>

          <p class="sidebar">For those who have seen the movie &quot;All About Steve&quot; ... Yes, a person who designs crossword puzzles is called a &quot;constructor.&quot; No, we don't all wear red boots. And no, it is not possible to create an American-style puzzle that is ALL about anyone, unless that person conveniently morphs to match a puzzle. </p>
          <p class="sidebar">On the other hand, I do recommend the documentary <strong>Wordplay</strong> as an introduction to the world of puzzlemaking.</p>

        <div id="mainContent">
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">Here are some common questions about Give a Crossword custom puzzles. If you don't see yours, please <a href="mailto:elizabeth@giveacrossword.org, ekhinshaw@aol.com">contact me</a>.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Is my puzzle generated by a computer?</strong> No. Your puzzle is generated by a person who uses software to help place words in the grid. The software reduces the time it takes and therefore the cost of the puzzle, but the soul of the puzzle is in the input you provide, and in the choices I make during its design.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Why can’t more personalized words be included?</strong> Unlike a &quot;crisscross&quot; puzzle, the crossword format produces a tightly meshed grid that limits the number of possible solutions. This is the magic of a crossword, since any clue can be solved by solving the clues of the crossing words. But it also makes complete customization effectively impossible.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>The words I don’t specify, where do they come from?</strong> I place your content on a grid and build the puzzle around it. Where possible, I select words that are meaningful to your audience. I use words that are in the dictionary or in common language, and I design the puzzle so that these words are interesting and lively, and have clues that your solver(s) are likely to enjoy.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Will I get a chance to provide input?</strong> Yes, you can be as involved as you would like to be. You will approve the puzzle’s theme before the puzzle is built, and you will have the opportunity to preview your puzzle.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>How is pricing determined?</strong> It takes many hours to craft a customized  puzzle. Pricing is based on my estimate of the time it will take to create a puzzle of a certain size, theme and level of difficulty. A large puzzle takes much longer than a smaller one. Creating a puzzle that is easy to solve actually takes more time than creating a difficult puzzle.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Do you create other types of puzzles?</strong> I offer American-format crossword puzzles and crisscross (vocabulary) puzzles. My computer will create a Sudoku or Word Find if you would like. For cryptics, UK and European-style crosswords and other puzzle types, I will refer you to a trusted colleague.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>How long does it take?</strong> The minimum time is one week; that depends on what else is in queue and how prepared you are with your input. Order as early as you can.</p>
