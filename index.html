          <p class="sidebar">For those who have seen the movie &quot;All About Steve&quot; ... Yes, a person who designs crossword puzzles is called a &quot;constructor.&quot; No, we don't all wear red boots. And no, it is not possible to create an American-style puzzle that is ALL about anyone, unless that person conveniently morphs to match a puzzle. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/features/popculture/a-crossword-expert-puzzles-over-sandra-bullocks-new-role/1035581" target="_blank">More Info</a>.</p>

          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">Here are some common questions about Give a Crossword custom puzzles. If you don't see yours, please <a href="mailto:elizabeth@giveacrossword.org, ekhinshaw@aol.com">contact me</a>.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Is my puzzle generated by a computer?</strong> No. Your puzzle is generated by a person who uses software to help place words in the grid. The software reduces the time it takes and therefore the cost of the puzzle, but the soul of the puzzle is in the input you provide, and in the choices I make during its design.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Why can’t more personalized words be included?</strong> Unlike a &quot;crisscross&quot; puzzle, the crossword format produces a tightly meshed grid that limits the number of possible solutions. This is the magic of a crossword, since any clue can be solved by solving the clues of the crossing words. But it also makes complete customization effectively impossible.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>The words I don’t specify, where do they come from?</strong> I place your content on a grid and build the puzzle around it. Where possible, I select words that are meaningful to your audience. I use words that are in the dictionary or in common language, and I design the puzzle so that these words are interesting and lively, and have clues that your solver(s) are likely to enjoy.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Will I get a chance to provide input?</strong> Yes, you can be as involved as you would like to be. You will approve the puzzle’s theme before the puzzle is built, and you will have the opportunity to preview your puzzle.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>How is pricing determined?</strong> It takes many hours to craft a customized  puzzle. Pricing is based on my estimate of the time it will take to create a puzzle of a certain size, theme and level of difficulty. A large puzzle takes much longer than a smaller one. Creating a puzzle that is easy to solve actually takes more time than creating a difficult puzzle.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Do you create other types of puzzles?</strong> I offer American-format crossword puzzles and crisscross (vocabulary) puzzles. My computer will create a Sudoku or Word Find if you would like. For cryptics, UK and European-style crosswords and other puzzle types, I will refer you to a trusted colleague.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>How long does it take?</strong> The minimum time is one week; that depends on what else is in queue and how prepared you are with your input. Order as early as you can.</p>

          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">The 21x21 square puzzle below was created for two preschool teachers (one of them an avid puzzler) and the class parents. It contains the names of the children in the class, with clues that are unique for each child.</p>
          <p align="center" class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>&quot;Three's Company&quot;</strong> (solution)</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><img src="images/TCSample2.jpg" alt="Sample Puzzle Solution" width="478" height="465" /></p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">The custom content of this puzzle (student names) is shown in bold type. Clues  used information provided by the parents, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="TabbedPanelsContent">“Three-year-old who wears his PJs under his clothes so he will always be ready for bedtime.” <br />
            </li>
            <li class="TabbedPanelsContent">“Three-year-old who is named after a poet who inspired the name of a famous musician”</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">            In addition to the names of the students, I included words relevant to the audience, such as BEACH BALL, NEMO, SHREK, and T SHIRT. Also, because a teacher was a Virginia Tech fan, I clued MASCOT as “HokieBird, for one.”</p>
