          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">The modern crossword puzzle first appeared in 1913, and was a national craze by the 1920s. They are still a fixture of American culture. Most  newspapers carry at least one daily puzzle, and they are enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. </p>
          <p class="MainH">Not So Simple</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">The crosswords you see in books and newspapers meet exacting standards for symmetry and composition. Those who solve crosswords regularly have an intuitive understanding of these rules, but may not realize all that goes into a puzzle's construction.</p>

          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">These puzzles look like a Scrabble board when you're done with a game - similar to a crossword, but not as dense. They're a popular format for grade-school textbook vocabulary puzzles, and many people call them &quot;crosswords.&quot; A crisscross has its uses, but a crossword fan is not likely to consider it a substitute.</p>

          <p class="sidebar">Crosswords are as much about <strong>culture</strong> as they are about language. &quot;Where's the beef?&quot; is unlikely to show up in a computer-generated puzzle.

          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">Here are some common questions about Give a Crossword custom puzzles. If you don't see yours, please <a href="mailto:elizabeth@giveacrossword.org, ekhinshaw@aol.com">contact me</a>.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Is my puzzle generated by a computer?</strong> No. Your puzzle is generated by a person who uses software to help place words in the grid. The software reduces the time it takes and therefore the cost of the puzzle, but the soul of the puzzle is in the input you provide, and in the choices I make during its design.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Why can’t more personalized words be included?</strong> Unlike a Scrabble-style puzzle (also known as a &quot;crisscross&quot;), the crossword format produces a tightly meshed grid that limits the number of possible solutions. This is the magic of a crossword, since any clue can be solved by solving the clues of the crossing words. But it also makes complete customization effectively impossible.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>The words I don’t specify, where do they come from?</strong> I place your content on a grid and build the puzzle around it. Where possible, I select words that are meaningful to your audience. I use words that are in the dictionary or in common language, and I design the puzzle so that these words are interesting and lively, and have clues that your solver(s) are likely to enjoy.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Will I get a chance to provide input?</strong> Yes. The questionnaire you complete when you order your puzzle is the first step in our partnership. You will approve the puzzle’s theme before the puzzle is built, and you will have the opportunity to preview your puzzle.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>How is pricing determined?</strong> It takes many hours to craft a customized  puzzle. Pricing is based on the time it takes to create a puzzle of a certain size and level of difficulty. A large puzzle takes much longer than a smaller one. Creating a puzzle that is easy to solve actually takes more time than creating a difficult puzzle.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>How long does it take?</strong> The minimum time is two weeks; that depends on what else is in queue and how prepared you are with your input. Order as early as you can.</p>
