          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">The modern crossword puzzle first appeared in 1913, and was a national craze by the 1920s. They are still a fixture of American culture. Most major newspapers carry at least one daily puzzle; they are enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>

          <pre class="TabbedPanelsContent">Here are some common questions about Give a Crossword custom puzzles.</pre>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>Is my puzzle generated by a computer?</strong> Your puzzle is generated by a PERSON who uses software to help place words in the grid. The software reduces the time it takes and therefore the cost of the puzzle, but the <strong>soul</strong> of the puzzle is in the input you provide, and in the choices I make during its design.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">            <strong>Why can’t more personalized words be included?</strong> Unlike a Scrabble-style puzzle (also known as a &quot;crisscross&quot;), the crossword format produces a tightly meshed grid that limits the number of possible solutions. This is the magic of a crossword, since any clue can be solved by solving the clues of the crossing words. But it also makes complete customization effectively impossible.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">            <strong>The words I don’t specify, where do they come from?</strong> I place your content on a grid and build the puzzle around it. Where possible, I select words that are meaningful to your audience. I use words that are in the dictionary or in common language, and I design the puzzle so that these words are interesting and lively, and have clues that your solver(s) are likely to enjoy.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">            <strong>Will I get a chance to provide input?</strong> Yes. The questionnaire you complete when you order your puzzle is the first step in our partnership. You will approve the puzzle’s theme before the puzzle is built, and you will have the opportunity to preview your puzzle.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">            <strong>How is pricing determined?</strong> It takes many hours to craft a customized crossword puzzle. Pricing is based on the time it takes to create a puzzle of a certain size,  level of difficulty and customization. A large puzzle takes much longer than a smaller one. Creating a puzzle that is easy to solve actually takes more time than creating a difficult puzzle.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">            <strong>How long does it take?</strong> The minimum time is two weeks; that depends on what else is in queue and how prepared you are with your input. Order as early as you can. </p>

        <div class="TabbedPanelsContent">
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">The 21x21 square puzzle below was created for two preschool teachers (one of them an avid puzzler) and the class parents. It contains the names of the children in the class, with clues that are unique for each child.</p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><img src="images/TCSample2.jpg" alt="samplegrid" width="550" height="536" /></p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">The custom content of this puzzle is shown in bold type (student names). Some sample clues, which used information provided by the parents: </p>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>“Three-year-old who wears his PJs under his clothes so he will always be ready for bedtime.” <br />
              </li>
              <li>“Three-year-old who is named after a  poet who inspired the name of a famous musician” </li>

          </ul>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">              In addition to the names of the students, I included words relevant to the audience, such as BEACH BALL, NEMO, SHREK, and T SHIRT. Also, because a teacher was a Virginia Tech fan, I clued MASCOT as “HokieBird, for one.”</p>

          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent"><strong>A Note About Scrabble-style or &quot;Crisscross&quot; Puzzles</strong></p>
          <p class="TabbedPanelsContent">These puzzles look like a Scrabble board when you're done with a game - similar to a crossword, but not as &quot;dense.&quot; They're a popular format for vocabulary puzzles such as the ones you may find in a grade school textbook. A crisscross can be an affordable alternative to a crossword. They are  easy to make; you should not pay more for a custom crisscross than you would pay to buy the software you could use to create one yourself.</p>
